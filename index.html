I will also consider anything that may be a bit challenging for me. So don't be shy and ask away!</p><h2>Can I suggest the design?</h2><p>May be, once I have all the details I will create someting that is simple, small and modern. I will take whatever description is sent to me and work from that, if I am not sure about something I will ask you.</p><h2>My request has been rejected, why?</h2><p> Perhaps it was innapropriate, not near my skill level or I am simply too busy.</p><h2>Do you have some examples?</h2><p>Yes, please take a look at my website <a href="http://www.lilianakastilio.co.uk">www.lilianakastilio.co.uk</a> for all my work. I also have some smaller examples on <a href="http://codepen.io/lili2311">Codepen.</a></p><h2>When will it be ready?</h2><p>I don't know, depends on how busy I am. I will do my best to have it done as quickly as I can, my guess would be between 1-4 weeks</p><h2>What is included?</h2><p> A fully functioning, responsive website that will work well on both desktop and mobile. I am happy to host any small websites for free as well. If you would like to buy a domain name (eg. www.mywebsitename.co.uk) for your website I can point you in the right direction, but this is at your own cost.</p><h2>Can I have the code?</h2><p>Absolutely, it is yours to do what you wish with. All code will be available on <a href="https://github.com/lili2311">GitHub.</a></p><h2>I want to change something! Help!</h2><p>Sorry but all desgns are final. Please make sure anything you send through is as you would like it on the finished site.
